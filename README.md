## PROJECT INTRODUCTION
Over the past five decades, a persistent transformation in global weather patterns has raised significant concerns for ecosystems worldwide. The focal point of this concern is climate change, denoting the prolonged alteration of conventional weather patterns and emerging as a pressing global issue. Its far-reaching impacts extend to various facets of human life, particularly in agriculture and food security. Aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal of eradicating hunger by 2023, the challenges faced by global food production are underscored, especially for staple crops like maize, wheat, rice, and potatoes, due to evolving weather conditions. This research underscores the intricate relationship between climatic shifts and staple food crop production. Harnessing the progress in machine learning (ML), the study seeks to predict and comprehend the implications of climate change on crop yield, employing supervised algorithms like Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forests Regression. With a focus on the USA, the analysis incorporates key climatic factors such as Solar Radiation, Temperature, Precipitation, and Atmospheric CO2 Concentration, elucidating their impact on maize, wheat, rice, and potato yields. In contributing to the understanding of the intricate dynamics between climate change and crop production, this research utilizes ML for comprehensive analysis and prediction.

## PROJECT PHASES
The approach to this analysis is broken down into 3 different phases:
PHASE I: Data Collection and Data Cleaning.
The data utilized in this project have been meticulously sourced from reputable secondary sources, where they have been consistently and systematically maintained over an extended duration by governmental agencies and international organizations.
PHASE II: Data Pre-processing for Statistical Analysis.
This procedure entails the application of various statistical methodologies to comprehend the complex interconnections, recognize trends and patterns, and quantify the associations between meteorological factors and the yields of essential food crops.
Phase III: Model Development
This encompasses the utilization of diverse machine learning algorithms, wherein variables are standardized to enhance analysis. The process involves partitioning them into training and testing sets, optimizing each algorithm through hyperparameter tuning, developing predictive models, and subsequently computing and comparing various performance metrics to identify the most effective model.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
This project addresses critical gaps in assessing how climate change impacts major food crops, focusing on maize, rice, wheat, and potato. 
1. It leverages powerful data science tools, it identify key climatic variables influencing crop yield, enabling targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies. 
2. It enhances model precision, offering more accurate projections of crop yields and aiding in understanding complex relationships for improved food security planning. 
3. Machine learning techniques capture non-linear correlations, providing insights that conventional models may overlook. 
The project's findings contribute to creating early warning systems, empowering stakeholders (Famers & Agricultural Policy makers) to proactively address disruptions in food production caused by climate change and mitigate its negative impact.
